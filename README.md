## The efficiency of merge sort
The merge sort algorithm has the time complexity of O(logN), meaning that the time required to execute N number of elements will rise in logarithmic proportion. If sorting an array of 10 elements requires 1ms, sorting an array of 100 elements will take 2ms.
Merge sort is much more efficient in time complexity than the insertion sort, but merge sort also consumes more space because the sorting is not in-place and the recursive call will be threaded. The merge sort will take O(N) space to perform the sorting.
